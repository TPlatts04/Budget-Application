# Budget Calculator

#Languages/Markups
This project was created with basic HTML5 for the structure, CSS3 for the styling and basic JavaScript for the interactivity and maths. Will be moving onto frameworks and other languages from now on.

# Purpose
This calculator can be used as a general budget calculator, but it is not recommended, due to the lack of expenses and income options available. If these options suit you however then feel free to use my calculator. This simple yet effective calculator will take in all the inputs that you provide it then give you a small breakdown while telling you how much you've/you'll save within the month. It also restricts the user from leaving any boxes empty.

# How to Use
Similar to all of my other repos:
1. Download the files and place them into a local folder
2. Open that folder in your IDE
3. Ensure to run html file from CMD or a local extension from your IDE
4. Test and Enjoy
